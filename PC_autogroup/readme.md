# PunctaCounterAutogroup_copy

This is for customizing module 2.Puncta 3D group: Puncta_CounterAutoGroup                 
-    
  1.You can custermize by changing the working folder, the size of processing image, the intensity and size threshold for the detected puncta, etc. After making the changes, you should rename the file to PunctaCounterAutogroup and replace the current version in the main folder. 
  2. Start Fiji, under [Plugins] tab, use [Compile and Run] to compile the specific module by running Puncta_CounterAutogroup. If you make changes to the main GUI Puncta_Counter, it's recommended to complile it first, since this functions (although unlikely) might be affected. 
  3. Restart Fiji and it should work using your custermized parameters. Know more about plugins and compilation at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/plugins.html and https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/howto/plugins/how_to_install_a_plugin
